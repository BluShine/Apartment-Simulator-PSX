  text: "I want this final record to be my confession. I\u2019ve watched everything
    from my apartment fearing that my employers would go after my family if I spoke
    out, but now that thing is coming for me and I can only hope that whoever reads
    this will confront those who are responsible. Don\u2019t go to the police, they
    won\u2019t help you; WynCo pays them to stay quiet in order to protect their
    image. It\u2019s why they fed us all the lie that Randall Waters disappeared
    over a drug dispute. When they find out why this is happening I have no doubt
    in my mind that everyone here will be in grave danger. WynCo hired me as a technician
    in an illegal program experimenting with the supernatural. They told us to keep
    quiet least we face serious repercussions. I\u2019m not that stupid. The creature
    they captured needs organic matter to replicate what it\u2019s given. It\u2019s
    the reason why this hallway keeps growing at an alarming rate\u2026 everyone
    here... A piece must have attached itself to my clothes\u2026 I fucked up so
    bad this time. They\u2019re all dead and it\u2019s all my fault. It spread throughout
    the 5th floor. It hungers. It\u2019s a creature that runs on instinct; I don\u2019t
    know for sure that it\u2019s intelligent but I know it\u2019s in pain. What we\u2019ve
    been doing to it in the lab is inhumane but WynCo can\u2019t afford to let their
    discovery go and I beg you to not let them get away with this. Whatever is waiting
    for me, I hope it can forgive me for what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m a coward.\r"
