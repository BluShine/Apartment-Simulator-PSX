  text: "There\u2019s a stench coming from Randall\u2019s apartment. I don\u2019t
    know how he stands it! He took offense when I asked him about the smell but it\u2019s
    impossible to miss it. We live right next to the elevator so I think most people
    are starting to opt for the stairs. If it was a matter of him needing help cleaning
    I would gladly offer my assistance but he always acts so hostile towards me that
    I\u2019m sometimes afraid of running into him in the hallway. I think the smells
    and sounds coming from Randall\u2019s apartment are also getting to Missy. She
    barks and scratches at the door all night but lately she\u2019s even turned her
    attention to barking at nothing. I hope it\u2019s not some sort of mold growing
    everywhere\u2026 I feel bad for Lee. He has enough on his plate as it is.\r"
