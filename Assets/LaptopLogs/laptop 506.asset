  text: "The hallway has grown another foot today. I don\u2019t think anyone notices
    that because they\u2019ve gotten so used to making their way from the stairs
    ever since the apartments next to the elevator started smelling so bad. I measured
    the other floors too and they\u2019re shorter than ours. None of the neighbors
    believe me when I tell them that we didn\u2019t always have a hallway that twists
    and turns like it does now. Everyone leaves overnight but the sounds I hear keep
    me awake. Every time I try explaining it to Barry he deflects the conversation.
    He\u2019s hiding something, I just know it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able
    to record any further changes. My body hurts so much now. It hurts. Why am I
    here? I\u2019m lost. What\u2019s happening to me? I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared.
    I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared. It hurts.\r"
