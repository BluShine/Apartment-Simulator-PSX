  text: "I\u2019ve been getting some bad vibes lately, man. I can tell I\u2019m being
    watched. Like\u2026 I hope this place isn\u2019t haunted. They\u2019ve got regular
    pest inspections, it shouldn\u2019t be haunted. The aura has been so off though
    and I can swear I smell copper all throughout the hallway. I know someone suggested
    foul play regarding someone here going \u201Cmissing\u201D but everyone\u2019s
    leaving so suddenly and I think it\u2019s because they can\u2019t take it here
    either. A shame that the girl down the hall left so soon after moving in\u2026
    she was pretty cute but I don\u2019t know if she likes girls\u2026 Not that I\u2019d
    be willing to talk to her if she still were here; my skin\u2019s blistering even
    on my face. I\u2019m not able to stay home all day even if I want to but when
    I go out I get stares. I cry when I come home and it only makes it hurt more.
    I\u2019m ashamed of the state I\u2019m in but I can\u2019t afford the time or
    the money to see a doctor right now. I feel like I\u2019m going to die in this
    place.\r"
