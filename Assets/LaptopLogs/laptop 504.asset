  text: "I feel kinda bad I still have boxes to unpack that are just sitting in the
    hallway but this apartment isn\u2019t exactly the roomiest place to store things
    in, oops. At least the neighbors seem trustworthy enough! I think when you live
    in a place like this there\u2019s a sort of kinship you form with everyone. At
    least that\u2019s what I assume. Of course I do also feel bad that that bulky
    sofa is in the hallway as well. I needed to trade it out for a new one because
    that stain from the previous owner is\u2026 yeah, no. If no one comes to claim
    it I might ask someone else to help me drag it out because I feel like everytime
    I look the stairway seems further and further away. I think it\u2019s just because
    I\u2019m weak and lazy lol. Other than that I think this place should work just
    fine as my first apartment. The equipment malfunctions and occasionally I have
    to wait for the water to run clear, but\u2026 you get what you pay for, I guess!\r"
