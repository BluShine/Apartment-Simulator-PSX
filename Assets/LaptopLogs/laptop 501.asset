  text: "I swear I haven\u2019t had a good night\u2019s sleep in the last few days
    and it\u2019s killing me. The neighbor\u2019s dog yapping this week is NOT helping
    but if it keeps its bitch of an owner up too then I\u2019ll be happy. She had
    the audacity to report me for some bullshit noise complaint. I told her it\u2019s
    the pipes or something but maintenance couldn\u2019t find a damn thing. There\u2019s
    a rumbling under my bed that keeps me up as well and room 401 apparently thinks
    I\u2019m stomping around up here or something. I think the bed is malfunctioning.
    I mean that\u2019s the only explanation I can find because Lee isn\u2019t helping
    any. He tries but I swear this place is falling apart on us. Am I just cursed?
    I can\u2019t take it here anymore. Every time I wake up I see that damn patronizing
    cat picture. I need to leave this place and when I do I\u2019m taking the fucking
    dog with me.\r"
