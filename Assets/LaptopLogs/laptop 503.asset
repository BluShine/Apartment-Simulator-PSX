  text: "The police dropped by earlier to ask about the guy in room 501 going missing.
    I have nothing to say; we never talked, in fact we made sure to avoid each other.
    It\u2019s not my problem. What is a problem for me is that I think that now my
    plumbing is acting up the way his did, which is juuust great and I\u2019m getting
    a rash as well. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the hard water or my skin not
    agreeing with the soap they use for the bedding but I should maybe schedule an
    appointment with the dermatologist.\r"
